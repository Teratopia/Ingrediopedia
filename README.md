# Ingrediopedia


Ingrediopedia was my first attept at using RESTful services with AngularJS. It was based on The Flavor Bible by K. Page and A. Dornenbug and uses thousands of free recipes to predict which ingredients will pair best with your chosen foods. Version 2 is in progress, but feel free to play around. Simply search an ingredient and start recipe building!

Version 1.0, 2.0 in progress
